            Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (1896â€“1940) was an American novelist,
            essayist, and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the
            greatest American writers of the 20th century. He is best known for
            his novel <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, a masterpiece of the Jazz Age.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            In his early years, Fitzgerald attended Princeton University but
            left before graduating to join the army during World War I. His
            literary career began with the publication of{" "}
            <em>This Side of Paradise</em> in 1920, which brought him immediate
            fame and success.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Fitzgerald's tumultuous marriage to Zelda Sayre and their
            extravagant lifestyle came to symbolize the flamboyance and excess
            of the 1920s. Despite his early success, his later years were marked
            by financial difficulties, declining health, and struggles with
            alcoholism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fitzgerald was recognized for his exceptional contribution to
            American literature, with <em>The Great Gatsby</em> now considered a
            cornerstone of American fiction and required reading in many
            educational institutions.
